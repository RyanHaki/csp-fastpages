### Questions
A lot of the questions consisted of those on collaboration and its benefits. It also asked questions about the Internet, such as protocols and data transmissions. There were also many questions that gave a block of code and asked for the result or an error in the code. A few problems even described programs and asked potential errors, inputs, outputs, and uses. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Most of these questions were fairly straightforward, but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking.

There were a lot of questions on collaboration and the Internet. There were also more questions about protocols and data transmissions. However, most of the problems were pseudocode where you are given a block of code and asked for the output or an error in the code. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Mostly they were easy for me because I have prior programming knowledge but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking.

### What I missed
I missed 4 questions. One of the questions I got wrong was due to a silly mistake. In that question, I had to add 8 with 4 and 4 and somehow got 12. I also missed couple questions because I just forgot some information on the internet and another simple problem. The last question I got wrong was due to me not realizing an integer could be a string.

### What I can do better
Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully and rechecking my answers after I'm done. I also have to remember to study the Internet, protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data transmissions and algorithms.
