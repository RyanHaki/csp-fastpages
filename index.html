| 1 | [Intro to Python](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//week/1) | [Hacks](https://github.com/Soham360/csp-fastpages/issues/3) | This week taught me how to personalize my blog. I also learned how to use bash, and some basics of bash while creating a bash script in Jupyter Notebooks. |
| 2 | [Data Abstraction](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP//week/2) | [Hacks](https://github.com/Soham360/csp-fastpages/issues/4) | We started to work with lists and dictionaries in Python. I learned how to append stuff to a dictionary, and how to use for loops and recursive loops to search through them. I created a second python quiz, this time using a dictionary to store the questions. We also worked on using HTML to customize our blogs. I was able to temporarily change the remote theme of my blog, as well as create a table to store everything we have done so far.  |
